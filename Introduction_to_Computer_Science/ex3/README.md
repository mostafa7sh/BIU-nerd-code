# Homework â€“ Logical Statements & Math Utilities

## Overview

This homework includes a C program (`ex_3.c`) that performs the following tasks:

- Evaluate logical statements with `&`, `|`, `~`, and comparisons (`<`, `>`, `=`)
- Count how many times a digit appears in a number (recursive)
- Calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers
- Exit the program with a goodbye message

## How to run

```bash
 gcc ex_3.c -o ex_3.out -lm -std=c99 -DNDEBUG
./ex_3.out
